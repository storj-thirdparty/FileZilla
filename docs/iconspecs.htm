<h1>FileZilla 3 Icon set specification</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document describes the requirements for icon sets in FileZilla 3.</p>

<p>
  Please remember that if you want to create an icon set for FileZilla,
  that you should be available to update the icon set in the future when
  additional icon are added to the requirements. Otherwise the default icons
  will be used for the missing icons and eventually your theme will be removed
  once it becomes too outdated.
</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>
  Since FileZilla is Free Software, the same has to apply to all artwork used
  in FileZilla. This means that all artwork has to be published under the GPL
  or a GPL compatible license.
  Note that the Creative Commons Attribution license is
  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html">not compatible</a>
  with the GPL.
</p>

<p>
  Each icon set should follow a theme, the icons should match nicely. Also,
  the function of the icon has to be easily recognizable.
</p>

<p>
  You should combine use of both color and shape. The icons are usually 
  displayed on a light background, though as we have no control
  over the background, all icons must also be recognizable on dark backgrounds
  or oddly coloured backgrounds. Avoid monochromatic icons.
</p>


<h3>Icon sizes</h3>

<p>
  All icons must exist in scalable form to accomodate modern high-DPI
  displays.
</p>

<p>
  The minimum size at which an icon can be displayed is 16x16 pixels. It is
  important, that the icons are good-looking at small sizes. Especially the
  smallest icon size should not look blurred beyond recognition. To improve
  visibily at these low sizes you can include icons in pre-rasterized form.
</p>

<p>The most commonly used small icon sizes are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>16x16</li>
  <li>20x20</li>
  <li>24x24</li>
  <li>32x32</li>
  <li>32x32</li>
  <li>48x48</li>
</ul>

<h3>Color depth</h3>

<p>
  Regarding the used color-depth there is no limitation.
</p>

<h3>File formats</h3>

<p>
  All icons have to be submitted in the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format
  and placed into a subdirectory named "scalable".
</p>

<p>
  As file format for optional fixed-size icons supplementing the scalable
  versions, the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format has to be used. For
  each provided size there has to be a subdirectory with the size as name
  ("16x16" for example) containing all icons in the corresponding size.
</p>
